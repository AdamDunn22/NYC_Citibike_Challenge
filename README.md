On this graph we are looking to see where most peopel start their trips and we can see that most of the female riders are closer within the city while the male riders are further out

## Summary
* Bike Repairs for 1/3 of the Citibikes need to be done during non-peak hours around 1-5 am.
* Male subscribers are the highest users and follow the traditional high use times of travel to and from work.
* Target market should be males needing transportation to work and weekend activities and push for subscribing to the services.

### Recommendations
* Adding the Start Location by Gender helped showed us where the majority of our target market starts their Journey and that allows to see where we should target advertising.
* The end Location helps shows us the distance most people travel and where we get a high volume of people for when they end their journey.
